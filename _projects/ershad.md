abstract: '
This project aims to develop e-Rshad, a conversational and adaptive navigation system designed for individuals with visual impairments. Its purpose is to enhance their navigation experience in complex public spaces such as shopping malls, museums, and airports. Traditional navigation tools often fall short in these areas due to their high cost, limited availability, and reliance on privacy-compromising cameras. This proposal aims to bridge these gaps by using alternative privacy-preserving sensor modalities like low-cost mmWave radar and low-resolution thermal sensors, along with recent advances in AI, to ensure reliable navigation. The project will also create comprehensive datasets tailored to assistive navigation, leading to advancements in the field. The contributions of this project will empower individuals with visual impairments, fostering their independence and improving their quality of life through a more accessible, privacy-aware indoor navigation solution.
