Welcome to the IMPACTLab, the Interdisciplinary Methods for Applied
Cyber-physical Technologies in Society Lab, where technology meets societal
needs. At IMPACTLab, we're dedicated to harnessing the power of cyber-physical
systems to address and solve real-world challenges that impact our communities.
<br/>

Our lab is a vibrant hub of innovation and collaboration, where
interdisciplinary teams of researchers, students, and industry experts come
together to develop groundbreaking solutions. We focus on creating systems that
are not only technologically advanced but also socially responsive and
sustainable.

<br/>

We believe in the transformative power of technology to improve lives. Our
projects range from developing smart systems for cleaning and inspection in
large-scale solar plants, to creating assistive technology to improve daily life
for individuals with disabilities, ensuring everyone can benefit from
technological advancements.

Join us as we explore the potential of cyber-physical systems to create a
smarter, safer, and more connected world.
