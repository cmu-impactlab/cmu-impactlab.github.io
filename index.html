      Technology evolves at an incredible pace, continually offering new
      opportunities to address and overcome societal challenges. At
      the <b>Interdisciplinary Methods for Applied Cyber-physical Technologies
      in Society</b> research lab, we embrace this rapid advancement, developing
      integrated cyber-physical systems that push the boundaries of what is
      possible, delivering pragmatic solutions for real-world issues that impact
      our communities. <br/>

Our lab is a hub of innovation and collaboration, where
interdisciplinary teams of researchers, students, and industry experts come
together to develop groundbreaking solutions. We focus on creating systems that
are not only technologically advanced but also socially responsive and
sustainable.

<br/>

We believe in the transformative power of technology to improve lives. Our
projects range from developing smart systems for cleaning and inspection in
large-scale solar plants, to creating assistive technology to improve daily life
for individuals with disabilities, ensuring everyone can benefit from
technological advancements.

Join us as we explore the potential of cyber-physical systems to create a
smarter, safer, and more connected world.
